## Purpose

This repository is designed to accelerate technical enablement for HEXAWARE by providing hands-on examples, reusable code, and best practices for building intelligent agent solutions on Azure. It covers agent creation, orchestration, file search, code execution, external integrations, and more.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your environment variables using `azure.env.sample` as a template, and rename to azure.env or .env and modify notebooks accordingly.
3. Install required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
4. Explore the Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step guides and code samples.
