      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Review and Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Flexibility: The code only matches exact greetings (e.g., \"hello\"), but won’t work for input like \"Hello there\" or \"hey!\". Consider checking if the greeting is contained in the input.\n",
      "2. Case-insensitivity: Use str.lower(), which is good, but also recommend trimming whitespace.\n",
      "3. Code readability: The variable and function names are clear and appropriate.\n",
      "4. Extensibility: For a larger set of greetings or more complex matching, consider using regular expressions for flexibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Improved version:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import re\n",
      "\n",
      "def respond_to_greeting(user_input):\n",
      "    greetings = ['hello', 'hi', 'hey', 'greetings']\n",
      "    cleaned_input = user_input.strip().lower()\n",
      "    # Check if any greeting is present as a whole word in the input\n",

      "        return \"Hello! How can I assist you today?\"\n",
      "    else:\n",
      "        return \"I'm here to help if you need anything!\"\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "- This version will respond to inputs like \"hello there\", \"Hey!\", or \"greetings, friend\".\n",
      "- It strips leading/trailing whitespace and does a case-insensitive whole word match.\n",
      "- If further extensibility is needed (for personalization, different languages, etc.), consider natural language processing libraries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary:\n",
      "- The original code is functional and clear for simple exact matches.\n",
      "- For improved user experience and flexibility, matching greetings as whole words via regular expressions is recommended.\n",
      "- Well-structured and easily extensible as is.\n",
